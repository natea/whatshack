# Local n8n Debugging Environment Setup Report

**Date:** 2025-05-16
**Relevant Project Plan Micro-task:** 1.3.5 (Verification of n8n Twilio webhook trigger - local debugging phase) from [`docs/project_plan.md`](docs/project_plan.md:49)
**Reference Debug Log for Strategy:** [`n8n_re_verification_debug.log`](n8n_re_verification_debug.log)
**Setup Log by Worker:** [`local_n8n_setup.log`](local_n8n_setup.log)

## 1. Overview

This report details the activities undertaken to set up a local n8n debugging environment. This was initiated as a strategic step to troubleshoot persistent errors with the Replit-hosted n8n instance, as outlined in [`n8n_re_verification_debug.log`](n8n_re_verification_debug.log). The goal is to verify the n8n workflow ([`n8n_workflows/Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio.json`](n8n_workflows/Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio.json)) in a controlled local environment.

## 2. Scaffolding Activities Performed (Delegated to `devops-foundations-setup` mode)

The `devops-foundations-setup` worker agent performed the following:

*   **Local n8n Instance Setup:**
    *   Guided the user to install n8n locally using `npm install n8n -g`.
    *   Confirmed the local n8n instance was running and accessible at `http://localhost:5678`.
*   **Workflow Import:**
    *   Guided the user to import the existing workflow from [`n8n_workflows/Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio.json`](n8n_workflows/Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio.json) into the local n8n instance.
    *   Confirmed successful import.
*   **ngrok Setup for Webhook Exposure:**
    *   Guided the user to set up ngrok to expose the local n8n webhook port (5678) to the public internet.
    *   The public ngrok URL obtained was: `https://2808-100-0-84-127.ngrok-free.app`.
*   **Log File Creation:**
    *   A detailed log of these setup steps, including the ngrok URL, was created by the worker: [`local_n8n_setup.log`](local_n8n_setup.log).

## 3. AI-Verifiable Outcomes Achieved

The following AI-verifiable outcomes, as defined in the task delegation, were met:

1.  **Confirmation of Local n8n:** A local n8n instance is running and accessible.
2.  **Confirmation of Workflow Import:** The workflow [`n8n_workflows/Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio.json`](n8n_workflows/Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio.json) has been imported into the local n8n.
3.  **Public ngrok URL:** The public ngrok URL `https://2808-100-0-84-127.ngrok-free.app` was generated.
4.  **Log File:** The setup process and outcomes were logged in [`local_n8n_setup.log`](local_n8n_setup.log).

## 4. Next Steps

With the local n8n environment set up and the webhook exposed via ngrok, the next steps, as outlined in [`n8n_re_verification_debug.log`](n8n_re_verification_debug.log:25-31), involve:

*   Temporarily reconfiguring the Twilio WhatsApp number's webhook to point to the ngrok URL.
*   Sending a test WhatsApp message to verify if the local n8n workflow triggers correctly.
*   Analyzing the results to determine if the issue lies with the workflow itself or the Replit n8n environment.

This local setup provides a crucial controlled environment for debugging the n8n integration.
