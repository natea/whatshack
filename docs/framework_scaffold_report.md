# Framework Scaffold Report - Township Connect

**Date:** 2025-05-17
**Project Plan:** [`docs/project_plan.md`](docs/project_plan.md)
**Architecture (Gateway Selection):** [`docs/gateway_selection_rationale.md`](docs/gateway_selection_rationale.md)
**n8n Instance URL:** https://n-8-n-ai-native-workflow-automation-natejaunetow.replit.app

## 1. Overview

This report details the initial framework scaffolding activities undertaken for the Township Connect project. The goal of this phase was to set up foundational elements as per Micro-task 1.3 of the project plan, focusing on n8n and WhatsApp gateway integration.

## 2. Scaffolding Activities Performed

The following activities were completed:

*   **Documentation Update (n8n Instance & Gateway Rationale):**
    *   The n8n service URL was recorded in [`docs/n8n_instance_details.md`](docs/n8n_instance_details.md).
    *   The [`docs/n8n_instance_details.md`](docs/n8n_instance_details.md) file and the existing [`docs/gateway_selection_rationale.md`](docs/gateway_selection_rationale.md) (confirming Twilio as the gateway) were registered in the project's [`.pheromone`](.pheromone) file.
*   **n8n Workflow Creation (Twilio Gateway):**
    *   An initial n8n workflow file, [`n8n_workflows/Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio.json`](n8n_workflows/Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio.json), was created. This workflow is designed to be triggered by incoming WhatsApp messages via Twilio.
*   **n8n Webhook Verification Attempt:**
    *   An initial attempt was made to verify the n8n webhook trigger by sending a test message.
    *   A re-attempt was made on 2025-05-16 to verify the webhook trigger (Micro-task 1.3.5).
    *   **Status:** BLOCKED. The n8n instance at the provided URL continues to experience the same internal error (`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getNode')`), which prevented the completion of the webhook verification. This issue was initially documented in [`n8n_setup.log`](n8n_setup.log).
    *   A new diagnostic log file [`n8n_re_verification_debug.log`](n8n_re_verification_debug.log) was created, containing detailed diagnostic findings and a recommendation for a local-first debugging approach.

*   **Local n8n Webhook Verification Attempt:**
    *   Following the recommendation in the debug log, a local verification attempt was made for the Twilio webhook (Micro-task 1.3.5).
    *   **Objective:** Verify local n8n Twilio webhook trigger for workflow "Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio.json".
    *   **Initial Status (2025-05-16):** FAILED.
    *   **Brief Reason for Initial Failure:** Test message was sent to Twilio, ngrok received POST requests to `/webhook/twilio` but returned `404 Not Found` errors, indicating the local n8n instance did not handle the request at this path.
    *   **Updated Status (2025-05-17):** SUCCESSFUL.
    *   **Key Corrective Actions:**
        *   Updated the workflow file [`n8n_workflows/Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio.json`](n8n_workflows/Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio.json) to explicitly set `parameters.path` to `twilio` and `parameters.httpMethod` to `POST`.
        *   Re-imported the corrected workflow into the local n8n instance.
        *   Verified the Webhook node's settings (Path: `twilio`, Method: `POST`) directly in the n8n UI, which appeared to be the final step needed for n8n to correctly register the production webhook path.
    *   Detailed findings, diagnostics, root cause analysis, and verification results are documented in [`local_n8n_verification.log`](local_n8n_verification.log).

## 3. Tools Used (by delegated agents)

*   File creation and modification tools (e.g., to write content to `.md`, `.json`, and `.log` files).

## 4. Initial Project Structure (Created/Modified Files)

The following files were created or modified during this scaffolding phase:

*   [`docs/n8n_instance_details.md`](docs/n8n_instance_details.md) (Created/Updated)
*   [`.pheromone`](.pheromone) (Updated with new documentation registry entries)
*   [`n8n_workflows/Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio.json`](n8n_workflows/Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio.json) (Created)
*   [`n8n_setup.log`](n8n_setup.log) (Created to document n8n setup process and current blocker)
*   [`n8n_re_verification_debug.log`](n8n_re_verification_debug.log) (Created to document re-verification attempt, diagnostic findings, and local debugging strategy)
*   [`local_n8n_verification.log`](local_n8n_verification.log) (Created to document local n8n webhook verification attempt, findings, and next steps)

## 5. Next Steps

*   The primary blocker for completing Micro-task 1.3 remains the internal error in the Replit-hosted n8n instance. However, the successful local verification of the Twilio webhook integration provides a functional alternative path forward.
*   The local n8n webhook verification for Micro-task 1.3.5 has been successfully completed. The webhook path `/webhook/twilio` is now correctly configured and functional in the local environment.
*   The corrected workflow file [`n8n_workflows/Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio.json`](n8n_workflows/Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio.json) can be used as a reference for configuring the Replit instance once its internal error is resolved.
*   With a functional local n8n webhook now established, the remaining parts of Micro-task 1.3 can proceed using the local environment.
*   Subsequent micro-tasks, such as MT1.4 (Python Core Logic for inbound message handling via n8n), can now proceed using the local n8n instance for development and testing.
