# Framework Scaffold Report - Supabase Schema Verification

**Date:** 2025-05-17

## 1. Objective

The objective of this scaffolding task was to ensure the correct application of the Supabase database schema defined in `db_scripts/db_schema_v1.sql` to the live Supabase instance, and to verify this by ensuring the tests in `tests/test_supabase_setup.py` pass when executed by `scripts/run_supabase_tests.sh`.

## 2. Activities Performed

*   **Initial Review:**
    *   Consulted the `.pheromone` file, specifically signal `a4d1b3f7-c8e6-4b0d-9a1f-e92345f87621` and the documentation registry.
    *   Reviewed the Master Project Plan ([`docs/project_plan.md`](docs/project_plan.md)), Micro-task 1.2 (criteria 1.2.3 and 1.2.4).
    *   Reviewed relevant documentation:
        *   [`db_scripts/db_schema_v1.sql`](db_scripts/db_schema_v1.sql)
        *   [`docs/SUPABASE_INTEGRATION.md`](docs/SUPABASE_INTEGRATION.md)
        *   [`scripts/apply_supabase_schema.py`](scripts/apply_supabase_schema.py)
        *   [`tests/test_supabase_setup.py`](tests/test_supabase_setup.py)
        *   [`scripts/run_supabase_tests.sh`](scripts/run_supabase_tests.sh)

*   **Schema Application Verification:**
    *   A `devops-foundations-setup` agent was tasked to ensure the schema was applied.
    *   The agent attempted to run [`scripts/apply_supabase_schema.py`](scripts/apply_supabase_schema.py). This script failed due to a client library compatibility issue (`SyncQueryRequestBuilder.execute() got an unexpected keyword argument 'options'`).
    *   However, the agent confirmed through alternative means that the schema was already correctly applied:
        *   Execution of [`scripts/run_supabase_tests.sh`](scripts/run_supabase_tests.sh) resulted in all tests in [`tests/test_supabase_setup.py`](tests/test_supabase_setup.py) passing (specifically `test_users_table_exists`, `test_service_bundles_table_exists`, `test_message_logs_table_exists`).
        *   Review of [`docs/SUPABASE_INTEGRATION.md`](docs/SUPABASE_INTEGRATION.md) indicated the schema was applied during a prior SPARC Refinement cycle.
        *   User-provided image confirmation (during the sub-task) showed the required tables present in the Supabase Studio.

## 3. Outcome

The Supabase database schema is correctly applied, and the tables `users`, `service_bundles`, and `message_logs` (as defined in [`db_scripts/db_schema_v1.sql`](db_scripts/db_schema_v1.sql)) exist in the Supabase database.
The AI-verifiable end result for this task (successful execution of [`scripts/run_supabase_tests.sh`](scripts/run_supabase_tests.sh) with all relevant tests passing) has been met.
