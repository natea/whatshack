# Framework Scaffolding Report: Micro-task 1.3 (WhatsApp Gateway Selection, Setup & Initial n8n Configuration)

This report summarizes the framework scaffolding activities performed for Micro-task 1.3 of the Township Connect project. These activities focused on establishing the foundational components for WhatsApp message handling via a selected gateway and the n8n workflow automation platform. All AI-Verifiable Deliverables for MT1.3, as specified in the [`docs/project_plan.md`](docs/project_plan.md:37-50), have been met.

## 1. Gateway Selection

**Twilio** was selected as the WhatsApp Gateway for this project. The rationale and details regarding this selection are documented in [`docs/gateway_n8n_setup_details.md`](docs/gateway_n8n_setup_details.md). This fulfills the deliverable of logging the gateway decision.

## 2. n8n Instance Setup

A functional n8n instance has been set up and is accessible at the following URL:
`https://n-8-n-ai-native-workflow-automation-natejaunetow.replit.app/`

The n8n API key, essential for programmatic interaction with the instance, is managed securely as a Replit secret named `N8N_API_KEY`. Further details on the n8n instance setup can be found in [`docs/gateway_n8n_setup_details.md`](docs/gateway_n8n_setup_details.md). This confirms the deliverable of a functional n8n instance with its URL and API key management strategy logged.

## 3. Twilio Configuration

The following Twilio configurations were addressed:
*   **Credentials:** Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, and the Twilio WhatsApp Sender Number (or Sandbox details) are required. These have been configured as credentials within the n8n instance to enable communication with the Twilio API.
*   **Webhook Configuration:** The Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox (or purchased number) has been configured to send webhooks for inbound messages to the specific URL provided by the n8n "Webhook" node in the `Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio` workflow.

Detailed information on these Twilio configurations is available in [`docs/gateway_n8n_setup_details.md`](docs/gateway_n8n_setup_details.md). These steps satisfy the deliverables related to Twilio credential and webhook configuration.

## 4. n8n Workflow Creation

An n8n workflow named `Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio` has been created and its definition is stored at [`n8n_workflows/Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio.json`](n8n_workflows/Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio.json).

The purpose of this workflow is to:
*   Be triggered by the webhook sent from Twilio upon receiving an incoming WhatsApp message.
*   Act as an initial placeholder for future integration, which will involve calling a Python API for message processing.
*   Include a placeholder for sending a reply message back through Twilio.

This completes the deliverable of creating the specified n8n workflow.

## 5. Webhook Trigger Verification

The "Message Received" trigger within the `Incoming_WhatsApp_Webhook_Twilio` n8n workflow, implemented using the n8n "Webhook" node, was successfully verified.

Evidence of this successful activation, which occurred upon sending a test message to the configured Twilio WhatsApp number, is recorded in the log file: [`logs/mt1.3_n8n_trigger_verification.log`](logs/mt1.3_n8n_trigger_verification.log). This fulfills the deliverable of verifying the gateway's "Message Received" trigger.

## 6. Conclusion

The scaffolding activities for Micro-task 1.3 are now complete. This involved the selection and initial configuration of Twilio as the WhatsApp gateway, the setup and configuration of the n8n instance, and the creation and initial verification of the n8n workflow designed to handle incoming WhatsApp messages. All specified AI-Verifiable Deliverables for this micro-task have been successfully met, establishing a solid foundation for subsequent development phases.
