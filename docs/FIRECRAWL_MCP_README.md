## MCP.Composio.dev - Model Context Protocol Integration Platform

### What is MCP.Composio.dev?

MCP.Composio.dev is a managed Model Context Protocol (MCP) server platform that solves key challenges in AI agent integrations:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**: Built-in authentication support for 300+ applications, handling OAuth, API keys, and basic auth flows automatically.

2. **Pre-built MCP Servers**: Ready-to-use MCP servers for popular services like GitHub, Slack, Linear, Google Workspace, and many others.

3. **Standardized Integration**: Follows the Model Context Protocol specification, making it compatible with any MCP-compliant client.

## How It Works

MCP.Composio.dev serves as a bridge between AI applications and external services:

1. **Client Connection**: AI applications (like Cursor IDE, Claude Desktop) connect to Composio MCP servers
2. **Authentication Handling**: Composio manages all authentication flows securely
3. **Tool & Resource Exposure**: Composio exposes standardized tools and resources for each integrated service
4. **Execution & Response**: When tools are called, Composio handles the API interactions and returns formatted responses

## Key Benefits

- **Zero Setup Integration**: Connect to 300+ apps with minimal configuration
- **Authentication Management**: No need to handle complex OAuth flows or API key storage
- **Standardized Interface**: Consistent tool and resource patterns across all integrations
- **Framework Support**: Works with OpenAI, Vercel AI SDK, LangChain, CrewAI and other frameworks

## Example Use Cases

- Connect AI agents to productivity tools (Slack, Gmail, Notion)
- Enable AI workflows with development tools (GitHub, Linear, Jira)
- Create AI assistants with access to enterprise systems
- Build multi-service workflows that operate across different platforms

MCP.Composio.dev eliminates the complexity of building and maintaining individual MCP servers, allowing developers to focus on creating AI experiences rather than integration details.

## Available Tools

  "scrapeOptions_formats": ["markdown", "html"], // Output formats
  "scrapeOptions_waitFor": 1000                // Wait time in ms before scraping
}
```

### 3. FIRECRAWL_EXTRACT

Extracts structured data from web pages using natural language prompts or JSON schemas.

```javascript
{
  "urls": ["https://example.com/products/*"],  // URLs to extract data from (supports wildcards)
  "prompt": "Extract product names, prices, and descriptions", // Natural language prompt
  "schema": {                                  // Alternative: JSON schema

      "description": "string"
    }]
  },

}
```

### 4. FIRECRAWL_SCRAPE_EXTRACT_DATA_LLM

Scrapes specific content from web pages with formatting options.

```javascript
{
  "url": "https://example.com",                // URL to scrape
  "onlyMainContent": true,                     // Only extract main content
  "formats": ["markdown"],                     // Output formats
  "waitFor": 1000,                             // Wait time in ms before scraping
  "actions": [                                 // Optional: Actions to perform before scraping
    {"type": "click", "selector": ".button"}

```

### 5. FIRECRAWL_SEARCH

Performs web searches and returns relevant results.

```javascript
{
  "query": "web scraping best practices",      // Search query
  "limit": 5,                                  // Maximum number of results
  "country": "US",                             // Country code for search results
  "lang": "en",                                // Language code for search results
  "formats": ["markdown"]                      // Output formats
}
```

### 6. FIRECRAWL_CRAWL_JOB_STATUS

Checks the status of a crawl job.

```javascript
{
  "id": "job-uuid-here"                        // ID of the crawl job
}
```

### 7. FIRECRAWL_CANCEL_CRAWL_JOB

Cancels a running crawl job.

```javascript
{
  "id": "job-uuid-here"                        // ID of the crawl job
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with smaller crawls and gradually expand scope
2. **Use Limits**: Always set appropriate limits to prevent excessive crawling
3. **Focus Crawling**: Use includePaths/excludePaths to target relevant content
4. **Respect Websites**: Add delays between requests and don't overload servers
5. **Monitor Jobs**: Use job status checks for long-running crawls
6. **Cancel When Needed**: Cancel unnecessary crawl jobs to save resources

// Example of mapping a website structure
{
  "server_name": "firecrawl",
  "tool_name": "FIRECRAWL_MAP_URLS",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "limit": 10
  }
}
```

  "tool_name": "FIRECRAWL_EXTRACT",
  "arguments": {
    "urls": ["https://example.com/products/*"],
    "prompt": "Extract product names, prices, and descriptions"
  }
}
```

  "arguments": {
    "query": "web scraping best practices",
    "limit": 5
  }
}
```

## Ethical Considerations

When using the Fire Crawler mode, always consider these ethical guidelines:

1. **Respect Terms of Service**: Always review and comply with a website's terms of service
2. **Respect robots.txt**: Honor the directives in robots.txt files
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement delays between requests to avoid overwhelming servers
4. **Data Privacy**: Handle personal information responsibly and in compliance with regulations
5. **Attribution**: Properly attribute content to its original source when republishing
6. **Transparency**: Be honest about your scraping activities and their purpose

## Use Cases

- **Market Research**: Gather competitor pricing and product information
- **Content Aggregation**: Collect news articles, blog posts, or other content
- **Data Analysis**: Extract structured data for analysis and insights
- **Lead Generation**: Gather contact information from business directories
- **Academic Research**: Collect data for research projects
- **SEO Analysis**: Monitor keyword rankings and content performance

## Troubleshooting

- **Rate Limiting**: If you encounter 429 errors, increase delays between requests
- **Blocked Access**: Some websites may block scraping; respect their terms of service
- **Timeout Errors**: For large crawls, use smaller batches and monitor job status
- **Data Quality**: Verify extracted data for accuracy and completeness
- **Format Issues**: Try different output formats if content isn't properly extracted
