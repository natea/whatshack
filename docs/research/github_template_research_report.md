# GitHub Template Research Report: Township Connect

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 17, 2025
**Author:** AI Assistant (Orchestrator GitHub Template Scout)

## 1. Introduction

This report details the research conducted to find suitable GitHub cookiecutter project templates to accelerate the development of the "Township Connect" project. The research was guided by the project's Master Project Plan ([`docs/project_plan.md`](docs/project_plan.md)), Master Acceptance Test Plan ([`tests/acceptance/master_acceptance_test_plan.md`](tests/acceptance/master_acceptance_test_plan.md)), Product Requirements Document ([`docs/prd.md`](docs/prd.md)), and associated strategic research documents.

The primary goal is to identify a template that aligns with the project's technical stack (Python core, Supabase/PostgreSQL, Redis, n8n, WhatsApp integration) and can provide a solid foundation for building the required features.

## 2. Project Requirements Summary for Template Selection

Based on the project documentation, a suitable template should ideally offer:

*   **Primary Language:** Python.
*   **Framework:** A modern Python web framework (e.g., FastAPI, Flask) is suitable, as the core logic will likely be invoked by n8n.
*   **Database Integration:** Support for PostgreSQL (compatible with Supabase), including ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy) or clear patterns for database interaction.
*   **Message Queue Integration:** Support for Redis.
*   **Modularity & Structure:** A clean, well-organized project structure that facilitates feature development, testing, and maintenance.
*   **Configuration Management:** Robust handling of environment variables and configurations.
*   **Testing:** Integrated testing framework (e.g., `pytest`).
*   **WhatsApp Specifics (Desirable but not essential if n8n handles gateway):** Basic structure for message handling or bot logic.

## 3. Search Strategy & Keywords

The following search queries were used on GitHub and general web searches for cookiecutter templates:

*   `python cookiecutter whatsapp bot`
*   `python cookiecutter chatbot`
*   `python cookiecutter supabase`
*   `python cookiecutter postgresql`
*   `python cookiecutter redis`
*   `python cookiecutter fastapi postgresql redis`
*   `python cookiecutter flask postgresql redis`
*   `python project template whatsapp`
*   `python backend template n8n`

**Note:** The Firecrawl MCP server, intended for web searching and scraping, consistently failed during the research phase. This significantly hampered the ability to discover and evaluate GitHub templates.

## 4. Considered Templates

Due to the failure of the primary research tool (Firecrawl MCP), a comprehensive search and evaluation of GitHub templates could not be completed.

One template, `tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql`, was identified based on general knowledge, but its README could not be scraped for detailed analysis due to the tool failure.

## 5. Comparative Analysis

A comparative analysis cannot be provided as multiple promising templates could not be identified and evaluated due to the failure of the Firecrawl MCP tool.

*(This section cannot be fully populated due to research tool limitations)*

## 6. Rationale for Final Decision

No template can be selected with a high degree of confidence due to the inability to conduct thorough research. The failure of the Firecrawl MCP tool prevented the necessary discovery and deep evaluation of potential templates against project requirements.

Therefore, the decision is **not to integrate any template at this time.**

## 7. Required Modifications (If Template Selected)
