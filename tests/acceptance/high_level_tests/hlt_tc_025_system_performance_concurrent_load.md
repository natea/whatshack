# HLT-TC-025: System Performance under Concurrent Load (Simulated)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 17, 2025
**Author:** AI Assistant (Claude)

## 1. Test Overview
This HLT verifies that Township Connect maintains acceptable performance under concurrent load by simulating multiple users accessing the system simultaneously and measuring response times and error rates.

## 2. User Story / Scenario
* **Feature (PRD 2.3):** Support for multiple concurrent users (implied by pilot goal of onboarding 50 active SMEs).
* **Scenario (HLT Strategy 4.6):** Simulate multiple concurrent users accessing the system. Verification: Response times remain acceptable and error rates are low.

## 3. Preconditions
* Township Connect is fully operational with all features and integrations enabled.
* A load testing tool or script is available that can simulate multiple concurrent WhatsApp users.
* System logging is configured to capture performance metrics (response times, error rates).
* Test environment is representative of production conditions (or differences are documented and accounted for).
* Baseline performance metrics have been established through single-user testing (HLT-TC-024).

## 4. Test Steps

| Step | Test Action | Expected System Response & Measurement |
|------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | Configure the load testing tool to simulate 10 concurrent users | Load testing tool is correctly configured with 10 virtual users and appropriate test scenarios. |
| 2 | Define test scenarios for each virtual user, including a mix of: <br>- Initial onboarding <br>- Payment link generation <br>- Sales/expense logging <br>- Information queries <br>- Language switching | Test scenarios are defined to represent realistic user behavior patterns. |
| 3 | Execute the load test with 10 concurrent users for 15 minutes | System handles all requests. Measure response times for each action type and record any errors. |
| 4 | Increase to 25 concurrent users and repeat the test for 15 minutes | System handles all requests. Measure response times for each action type and record any errors. |
| 5 | Increase to 50 concurrent users (representing the pilot goal) and repeat the test for 15 minutes | System handles all requests. Measure response times for each action type and record any errors. |
| 6 | Increase to 75 concurrent users (150% of pilot goal) to test system headroom and repeat the test for 15 minutes | System handles all requests, potentially with some degradation in performance but without critical failures. Measure response times and error rates. |
| 7 | Execute a "spike test" by suddenly increasing from 10 to 50 users | System recovers and stabilizes within an acceptable timeframe. Measure recovery time and error rates during the spike. |
| 8 | Execute a "sustained load test" with 50 concurrent users for 2 hours | System maintains consistent performance throughout the extended test period. Measure response times and error rates over time to detect any degradation. |
| 9 | Analyze all collected metrics to determine if performance requirements are met | Analysis confirms that under the target load of 50 concurrent users: <br>- Average response time for critical actions remains <10s <br>- Average response time for non-critical actions remains <15s <br>- Error rate remains below 1% |

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (AI Verifiable)
* Under a concurrent load of 50 users (the pilot program target):
  * Average response time for critical actions (payment link generation, sales logging) remains <10 seconds
  * Average response time for non-critical actions remains <15 seconds
  * 95th percentile response times do not exceed 15 seconds for critical actions
  * Error rate remains below 1% of all requests
* The system recovers from load spikes within 2 minutes
* Performance remains stable during sustained load testing (no progressive degradation)
* No system crashes or service interruptions occur during any phase of load testing
* Database performance (query times) remains within acceptable limits
* External API integrations continue to function correctly under load
* System resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) remains below 80% of capacity

## 7. Notes
* This test focuses specifically on system performance under load, not on the functional correctness of the responses.
* For AI verification purposes, performance logs and metrics should be analyzed.
* The test should use realistic user behavior patterns, including:
  * Varied request types
  * Natural pauses between actions
  * Distribution across different languages
  * Mix of new and returning users
* If direct WhatsApp API load testing is not feasible, alternative methods such as:
  * Simulating load at the API gateway level
  * Direct database and service load testing
  * Component-level performance testing
  * May be used as alternative verification approaches.
* Special attention should be paid to:
  * Database connection pooling efficiency
  * Message queue processing rates
  * External API throttling limits
  * Resource contention points
* This test is critical for ensuring Township Connect can support the pilot program goal of 50 active SMEs and can scale beyond that for future growth.
* Performance testing should be repeated after any significant system changes or before major user onboarding phases.
