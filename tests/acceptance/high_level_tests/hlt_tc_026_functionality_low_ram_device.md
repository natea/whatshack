# HLT-TC-026: Functionality on Simulated Low-RAM Device Environment

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 17, 2025
**Author:** AI Assistant (Claude)

## 1. Test Overview
This HLT verifies that Township Connect functions properly on low-resource devices by testing key user flows on actual low-spec devices or emulators configured to simulate low RAM and CPU conditions, ensuring accessibility for township residents with basic smartphones.

## 2. User Story / Scenario
* **Feature (PRD 2.3):** Support low-RAM Android phones with graceful fallbacks.
* **Scenario (HLT Strategy 4.6):** Test on a simulated low-RAM device environment or with actual low-spec devices if available. Verification: System remains responsive and functional.

## 3. Preconditions
* Township Connect is fully operational with all features and integrations enabled.
* Test devices or emulators are available that represent the minimum supported specifications:
  * Low-end Android device with ≤1GB RAM
  * Limited CPU (e.g., entry-level processor)
  * Limited storage space
  * Basic version of WhatsApp that runs on low-spec devices
* System logging is configured to capture resource usage and performance metrics.
* A set of key user flows has been defined for testing.

## 4. Test Steps

| Step | Test Action | Expected System Response & Observation |
|------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | Set up test device(s) or emulator(s) with the following specifications: <br>- Android device with 1GB RAM or less <br>- Entry-level processor <br>- Limited storage space <br>- Basic version of WhatsApp | Test environment is correctly configured to represent low-resource devices used by target users in townships. |
| 2 | If using emulators, configure resource constraints: <br>- Limit RAM to 1GB <br>- Limit CPU performance <br>- Simulate slower network conditions typical in townships | Emulator is correctly configured to simulate resource constraints. |
| 3 | Install and set up WhatsApp on the test device/emulator | WhatsApp is installed and functioning on the test device. |
| 4 | Connect the test device/emulator to Township Connect via WhatsApp | Connection is established successfully. |
| 5 | Execute the onboarding flow: <br>- Send initial greeting <br>- View POPIA notice <br>- Provide consent <br>- Select service bundle | Complete onboarding process executes without crashes, excessive delays, or UI issues. Monitor device resource usage (RAM, CPU). |
| 6 | Execute core business functionality: <br>- Generate payment link <br>- Log sales <br>- Track expenses | Core business functions execute without crashes, excessive delays, or UI issues. Monitor device resource usage. |
| 7 | Execute information access flows: <br>- Request directions <br>- Ask knowledge base questions <br>- Request business tips | Information access functions execute without crashes, excessive delays, or UI issues. Monitor device resource usage. |
| 8 | Execute language switching: <br>- Switch between all three supported languages | Language switching executes without crashes, excessive delays, or UI issues. Monitor device resource usage. |
| 9 | Execute multiple consecutive operations without closing WhatsApp | System remains responsive and stable during extended usage sessions. No memory leaks or progressive performance degradation observed. |
| 10 | Monitor system logs and device metrics throughout testing | Logs show no excessive resource consumption warnings, crashes, or performance degradation related to device limitations. |

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (AI Verifiable)
* All key user flows execute successfully on low-RAM devices/emulators without:
  * Application crashes
  * Excessive delays (beyond the standard response time thresholds)
  * UI rendering issues
  * WhatsApp freezing or becoming unresponsive
* System resource usage remains within acceptable limits:
  * RAM usage does not cause device memory pressure warnings
  * CPU usage does not cause excessive device heating or throttling
  * Storage requirements remain minimal
* If resource limitations are encountered, the system implements graceful fallbacks rather than failing completely.
* The user experience, while potentially slower than on high-end devices, remains functional and usable.
* System logs show no excessive resource consumption warnings or errors related to device limitations.
* The system maintains data efficiency (≤5KB per interaction) even on low-resource devices.

## 7. Notes
* This test focuses specifically on functionality under resource constraints, not on the correctness of the responses.
* For AI verification purposes, device logs, screenshots, and performance metrics should be analyzed.
* Testing should ideally be performed on actual low-end devices commonly used in Cape Town townships, if available.
* If actual devices are not available, emulators should be configured to closely match the specifications of common low-end devices in the target market.
* Special attention should be paid to:
  * Memory usage patterns over time (to detect memory leaks)
  * Response time degradation during extended sessions
  * Battery consumption
  * Data usage efficiency
* This test is critical for ensuring Township Connect is truly accessible to all target users, regardless of their device limitations.
* Consider testing with various versions of WhatsApp, including older versions that might be used on legacy devices.
* Document any graceful degradation strategies implemented (e.g., simplified UI, pagination of long responses, reduced image quality) and verify they work as intended.
