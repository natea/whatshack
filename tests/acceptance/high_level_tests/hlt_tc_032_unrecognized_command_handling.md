# HLT-TC-032: Unrecognized Command Handling

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 17, 2025
**Author:** AI Assistant (Claude)

## 1. Test Overview
This HLT verifies that Township Connect handles unrecognized commands gracefully by providing standardized, user-friendly error messages in the user's current language, along with guidance on valid commands or alternative actions.

## 2. User Story / Scenario
* **Feature:** Robust error handling for unrecognized user inputs.
* **Scenario (HLT Strategy 4.8):** Unrecognized Command Handling. User sends an unrecognized command. System responds with a standardized, user-friendly error message in the user's current language, guiding them on valid commands.

## 3. Preconditions
* Township Connect is fully operational with error handling mechanisms implemented.
* Test WhatsApp accounts are set up with different language preferences (English, isiXhosa, and Afrikaans).
* System logging is configured to capture error events.

## 4. Test Steps

| Step | Test Action | Expected System Response & Verification |
|------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | **English User:** Send a completely random string that doesn't match any known command: "xyzabc123" | System recognizes the input as an unrecognized command. System responds with a standardized error message in English. Message is user-friendly and provides guidance on valid commands or how to get help. System logs the unrecognized command event. |
| 2 | **isiXhosa User:** Send the same random string: "xyzabc123" | System responds with an equivalent error message in isiXhosa. Message provides the same level of guidance as the English version. System logs the unrecognized command event. |
| 3 | **Afrikaans User:** Send the same random string: "xyzabc123" | System responds with an equivalent error message in Afrikaans. Message provides the same level of guidance as the English version. System logs the unrecognized command event. |
| 4 | **English User:** Send a string that resembles a valid command but contains errors: "Snapscan seventy five" (using words instead of numbers) | System recognizes the input as similar to a valid command but incorrectly formatted. System responds with a more specific error message in English that suggests the correct format. System logs the error event. |
| 5 | **isiXhosa User:** Send a string that resembles a valid command but contains errors: "Intengiso amashumi amahlanu" (sale fifty in words) | System responds with a more specific error message in isiXhosa that suggests the correct format. System logs the error event. |
| 6 | **Afrikaans User:** Send a string that resembles a valid command but contains errors: "Verkoop vyftig" (sale fifty in words) | System responds with a more specific error message in Afrikaans that suggests the correct format. System logs the error event. |
| 7 | **English User:** Send multiple consecutive unrecognized commands | System responds consistently to each unrecognized command. Error messages may provide increasingly detailed help or suggest contacting support after multiple errors. System logs all error events. |
| 8 | **All Users:** After receiving an error message for an unrecognized command, follow the guidance provided (e.g., use a suggested valid command) | System processes the valid command correctly. The error recovery path works as intended. |

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (AI Verifiable)
* The system correctly identifies unrecognized commands and responds with appropriate error messages.
* Error messages are provided in the user's current language preference (English, isiXhosa, or Afrikaans).
* Error messages are user-friendly, avoiding technical jargon or blame language.
* Error messages provide helpful guidance on valid commands or how to get help.
* For inputs that resemble valid commands but contain errors, the system provides more specific guidance on the correct format.
* The system maintains a consistent error handling approach across all supported languages.
* Error messages are concise and data-light (â‰¤5KB).
* The system logs all unrecognized command events for monitoring and improvement purposes.
* After receiving guidance, users can successfully recover by using valid commands.
* The system remains stable and responsive after processing unrecognized commands.

## 7. Notes
* This test focuses specifically on handling unrecognized commands, which is a subset of the broader error handling capabilities tested in HLT-TC-018.
* For AI verification purposes, system responses and error logs should be analyzed.
* The test should cover various types of unrecognized inputs:
  * Completely random strings
  * Misspelled commands
  * Commands with incorrect syntax
  * Commands in the wrong language
  * Valid words but not valid commands
* Special attention should be paid to:
  * Consistency of error messages across languages
  * Helpfulness and clarity of guidance
  * Ability to detect commands that are close to valid ones and provide specific guidance
  * Progressive help for users who make multiple errors
* This test is important for ensuring a good user experience, especially for new users who may not be familiar with the system's commands.
* Consider testing with various user profiles (e.g., new users vs. experienced users) to ensure error messages are appropriate for different levels of system familiarity.
* Verify that error handling doesn't reveal sensitive system information or implementation details.
