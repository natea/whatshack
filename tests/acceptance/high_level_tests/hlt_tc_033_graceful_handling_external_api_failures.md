# HLT-TC-033: Graceful Handling of External API Failures

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 17, 2025
**Author:** AI Assistant (Claude)

## 1. Test Overview
This HLT verifies that Township Connect handles external API failures gracefully by properly logging errors, providing user-friendly error messages in the appropriate language, and suggesting alternative actions when possible.

## 2. User Story / Scenario
* **Feature:** Robust error handling for external service dependencies.
* **Scenario (HLT Strategy 4.8):** Graceful Handling of External API Failures. Simulating a failure from an external API (e.g., payment gateway via Composio returns an error). System logs the error, informs the user gracefully in their language about the issue, and provides alternative steps if applicable (e.g., "Please try again later").

## 3. Preconditions
* Township Connect is fully operational with external API integrations configured.
* Test WhatsApp accounts are set up with different language preferences (English, isiXhosa, and Afrikaans).
* System logging is configured to capture API errors and error handling events.
* Test environment allows for simulation of API failures (e.g., through mock services or controlled test environments).

## 4. Test Steps

| Step | Test Action | Expected System Response & Verification |
|------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | Configure system logging to capture detailed information about external API interactions and error handling | Logging is correctly configured to capture API requests, responses, errors, and error handling actions. |
| 2 | **Payment Gateway API Failure:** Simulate a Composio API failure when an English-speaking user requests a payment link: "SnapScan 75" | System attempts to call Composio API. API failure is detected. System logs the error with appropriate details. System responds to the user with a user-friendly error message in English explaining the issue and suggesting alternatives (e.g., "We're having trouble connecting to our payment service. Please try again in a few minutes."). No system crash occurs. |
| 3 | Repeat the payment gateway API failure test with an isiXhosa-speaking user | System provides an equivalent error message in isiXhosa with the same level of helpfulness. |
| 4 | Repeat the payment gateway API failure test with an Afrikaans-speaking user | System provides an equivalent error message in Afrikaans with the same level of helpfulness. |
| 5 | **Mapping Service API Failure:** Simulate a mapping service API failure when a user requests directions: "Directions to Khayelitsha Clinic" | System attempts to call mapping service API. API failure is detected. System logs the error with appropriate details. System responds to the user with a user-friendly error message explaining the issue and suggesting alternatives. No system crash occurs. |
| 6 | **Temporary vs. Permanent Failures:** Simulate different types of API failures: <br>- Temporary network timeout <br>- Service unavailable error <br>- Authentication failure <br>- Invalid request error | System distinguishes between different types of failures where possible. Error messages are appropriate to the failure type (e.g., suggesting retry for temporary issues vs. contacting support for authentication issues). System logs contain detailed error information for troubleshooting. |
| 7 | **Retry Mechanism:** If the system implements automatic retry for transient failures, simulate a temporary API failure followed by successful response | System attempts to retry the API call after initial failure. Upon successful retry, the original user request is fulfilled. User is not exposed to the temporary failure. System logs show the failure, retry attempt, and successful completion. |
| 8 | **Fallback Mechanism:** If the system implements fallback options for certain API failures, simulate a failure that should trigger the fallback | System detects the API failure and activates the fallback mechanism. User request is fulfilled through the alternative method. User is informed if the result is different from the primary method. System logs show the failure and fallback activation. |
| 9 | **Multiple Consecutive Failures:** Simulate persistent API failures across multiple user requests | System handles all failures gracefully. Error messages may evolve to provide more detailed guidance after multiple failures. System remains stable and responsive. System logs capture all failure events. |
| 10 | **Recovery Testing:** After simulating API failures, restore normal API functionality and verify system recovery | System successfully resumes normal API interactions. Subsequent user requests are processed correctly. No lingering effects from previous failures are observed. |

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (AI Verifiable)
* The system detects all external API failures and responds appropriately.
* Error messages are provided in the user's current language preference (English, isiXhosa, or Afrikaans).
* Error messages are user-friendly, avoiding technical jargon or blame language.
* Error messages provide helpful guidance, including:
  * Clear explanation of the issue (without exposing sensitive technical details)
  * Suggested alternative actions where applicable
  * Expected resolution timeframe if known
* The system distinguishes between different types of API failures where possible and tailors responses accordingly.
* All API failures are logged with sufficient detail for troubleshooting, including:
  * Timestamp
  * API endpoint
  * Request parameters (excluding sensitive data)
  * Error response or exception details
  * Actions taken in response to the failure
* If implemented, retry mechanisms function correctly for transient failures.
* If implemented, fallback mechanisms activate appropriately when primary methods fail.
* The system remains stable and responsive during and after API failures.
* The system recovers gracefully when API functionality is restored.

## 7. Notes
* This test focuses specifically on handling external API failures, which is a critical aspect of system reliability in a service-oriented architecture.
* For AI verification purposes, system responses, error logs, and API interaction records should be analyzed.
* The test should cover all major external API integrations used by Township Connect, including:
  * Payment gateways via Composio
  * Mapping/directions services
  * Any other third-party services
* Special attention should be paid to:
  * Consistency of error handling across different APIs
  * Appropriate error message content for different failure types
  * Protection of users from technical details while providing helpful guidance
  * System stability during API failures
  * Proper logging for troubleshooting
* This test is important for ensuring a good user experience even when external dependencies fail.
* Consider testing with various network conditions that might affect API reliability:
  * High latency
  * Intermittent connectivity
  * Partial responses
* Verify that error handling doesn't reveal sensitive system information or implementation details.
