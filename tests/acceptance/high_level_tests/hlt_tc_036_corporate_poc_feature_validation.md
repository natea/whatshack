# HLT-TC-036: Corporate PoC Feature Validation

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 17, 2025
**Author:** AI Assistant (Claude)

## 1. Test Overview
This HLT verifies that Township Connect supports the pilot program goal of securing a paid corporate Proof of Concept (PoC) within 90 days by ensuring that corporate-specific features, such as anonymized data views, sub-tenant management, and analytics dashboards, function correctly and provide value to potential corporate partners.

## 2. User Story / Scenario
* **Feature (PRD 2.3):** Secure a paid Proof of Concept (PoC) with a corporate partner within 90 days.
* **Scenario:** Corporate-specific features are tested and verified to work as specified for a corporate test user. Access to anonymized trend data dashboard (if part of MVP) shows expected aggregated data.

## 3. Preconditions
* Township Connect is fully operational with corporate-focused features enabled.
* Test corporate account with appropriate permissions is set up in the system.
* Sufficient test data exists in the system to demonstrate aggregated analytics and trends.
* Database access is available for verification.
* Corporate PoC features have been defined and implemented based on requirements.

## 4. Test Steps

| Step | Test Action | Expected System Response & Verification |
|------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Corporate Dashboard Access:** Log in as a corporate test user to the corporate dashboard (if implemented as a separate interface) | Corporate dashboard loads successfully. Authentication works correctly. Dashboard displays appropriate corporate branding and features. |
| 2 | **Anonymized Data Views:** Access anonymized trend data for SME activities | System displays aggregated, anonymized data about SME activities (e.g., transaction volumes, popular services, geographic distribution). No personally identifiable information (PII) is exposed. Data is presented in a clear, insightful format. |
| 3 | **Data Filtering & Segmentation:** Apply filters to view data by different segments (e.g., business type, location, time period) | Filtering controls work correctly. Data updates to reflect selected filters. Segmentation provides meaningful insights. |
| 4 | **Sub-Tenant Management:** If the PoC includes sub-tenant features, create and manage a test sub-tenant | Sub-tenant creation works correctly. Corporate user can assign permissions and features to the sub-tenant. Sub-tenant appears in management interface. Database reflects the new sub-tenant relationship. |
| 5 | **Corporate Service Integration:** Test any specific integrations with corporate services (e.g., corporate payment systems, loyalty programs) | Integration functions correctly. Data flows appropriately between Township Connect and corporate systems. Error handling works as expected. |
| 6 | **Custom Analytics:** Generate custom analytics reports based on specific corporate requirements | Report generation works correctly. Reports contain accurate data. Export functionality (if available) works as expected. |
| 7 | **Data Export:** Test the export of anonymized data in required formats (e.g., CSV, Excel, API) | Export functionality works correctly. Exported data is properly formatted and anonymized. All required data fields are included. |
| 8 | **Corporate User Management:** Add, modify, and remove corporate user accounts with different permission levels | User management functions work correctly. Permission levels are properly enforced. Database reflects user changes. |
| 9 | **Corporate Branding:** Verify any corporate branding features (e.g., custom messages, logos) | Branding elements appear correctly in the interface. Customizations are applied as specified. |
| 10 | **Security & Compliance:** Verify that corporate access adheres to data protection requirements | Access controls work correctly. Audit logs capture corporate user actions. Data anonymization is consistently applied. POPIA compliance is maintained. |

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (AI Verifiable)
* Corporate users can successfully access the corporate dashboard or interface.
* Anonymized trend data is accurately displayed without exposing PII.
* Data filtering and segmentation controls function correctly and provide meaningful insights.
* If implemented, sub-tenant management features work correctly.
* Corporate service integrations function as specified.
* Custom analytics reports generate accurate, relevant data.
* Data export functionality produces properly formatted and anonymized data.
* Corporate user management features correctly handle different permission levels.
* Corporate branding elements appear correctly throughout the interface.
* All corporate features maintain security and compliance with data protection requirements.
* The system demonstrates clear value proposition for corporate partners, supporting the goal of securing a paid PoC within 90 days.

## 7. Notes
* This test focuses specifically on the corporate-focused features of Township Connect, which are critical for achieving the pilot program goal of securing a paid corporate PoC.
* For AI verification purposes, dashboard displays, exported data, and database records should be analyzed.
* The specific features tested may vary based on the defined scope of the corporate PoC, which may evolve based on discussions with potential corporate partners.
* Special attention should be paid to:
  * Data anonymization to ensure no PII is exposed to corporate users
  * Value of insights provided through analytics and trend data
  * Usability of the corporate interface
  * Performance of data aggregation and reporting functions
  * Security and access controls for corporate users
* This test complements other tests but focuses specifically on features that would be valuable to corporate partners.
* Consider testing with various corporate user profiles (e.g., executive, analyst, administrator) to ensure the system meets the needs of different corporate stakeholders.
* While this test verifies the system's capability to support a corporate PoC, actual achievement of this pilot goal will depend on business development efforts and corporate partner engagement.
* Document any corporate-specific customizations or configurations required for the PoC, as these may need to be replicated for future corporate partners.
