# HLT-TC-024: System Response Time for Critical Actions (<10s)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 17, 2025
**Author:** AI Assistant (Claude)

## 1. Test Overview
This HLT verifies that Township Connect maintains acceptable performance by ensuring that all critical user actions receive a system response within 10 seconds, providing a responsive experience even in resource-constrained environments.

## 2. User Story / Scenario
* **Feature (PRD 8.1):** (Implied) Critical actions should have response times <10 seconds.
* **Scenario (HLT Strategy 4.6):** Measure response times for critical actions to ensure they remain acceptable (e.g., critical actions <10 seconds as per PRD 8.1).

## 3. Preconditions
* Township Connect is fully operational with all features and integrations enabled.
* System logging is configured to capture accurate timestamps for message receipt and response dispatch.
* Test WhatsApp account is set up and connected to Township Connect.
* Test environment is representative of production conditions (or performance differences are documented and accounted for).

## 4. Test Steps

| Step | User Action (via WhatsApp) | Expected System Response & Measurement |
|------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | Ensure system logging is configured to capture timestamps for message receipt and response dispatch | Logging is correctly configured to capture the necessary timing data with millisecond precision. |
| 2 | Send initial greeting to trigger onboarding: "Hello" | System responds with welcome message and POPIA notice. Measure the time between message receipt and response dispatch. Should be <10 seconds. |
| 3 | Request a payment link: "SnapScan 75" | System generates and returns a payment link. Measure the time between message receipt and response dispatch. Should be <10 seconds. |
| 4 | Request a MoMo payment link: "MoMo link 100" | System generates and returns a MoMo payment link. Measure the time between message receipt and response dispatch. Should be <10 seconds. |
| 5 | Log a sale: "Sale 50 snacks" | System confirms the sale has been logged. Measure the time between message receipt and response dispatch. Should be <10 seconds. |
| 6 | Log an expense: "Expense R30 transport" | System confirms the expense has been logged. Measure the time between message receipt and response dispatch. Should be <10 seconds. |
| 7 | Switch language: "/lang isiXhosa" | System confirms language change. Measure the time between message receipt and response dispatch. Should be <10 seconds. |
| 8 | Request directions: "Directions to Khayelitsha Clinic" | System provides text-based directions. Measure the time between message receipt and response dispatch. Should be <10 seconds. |
| 9 | Request business information: "How to register my business?" | System responds with business registration information. Measure the time between message receipt and response dispatch. Should be <10 seconds. |
| 10 | Request data deletion: "/delete" | System asks for confirmation. Measure the time between message receipt and response dispatch. Should be <10 seconds. |

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (AI Verifiable)
* All critical user actions receive a system response within 10 seconds from message receipt to response dispatch.
* Critical actions include but are not limited to:
  * Initial onboarding and welcome
  * Payment link generation (SnapScan, MoMo)
  * Sales and expense logging
  * Language switching
  * Directions requests
  * Information queries
  * Data management operations
* Response time is measured from the moment the system receives the user's message to the moment the system dispatches its response.
* The performance requirement is met consistently across multiple test runs.
* The performance requirement is met across all three supported languages (English, isiXhosa, and Afrikaans).
* System logs clearly show the timing data that can be verified by AI or human reviewers.

## 7. Notes
* This test focuses specifically on system response time, not on the functional correctness of the responses.
* For AI verification purposes, system logs showing timestamp data should be analyzed.
* The test should be performed under conditions that reasonably approximate real-world usage:
  * During typical business hours
  * With a representative level of system load
  * Using network conditions similar to those in target townships
* If direct system logging is not available, alternative methods such as:
  * WhatsApp API delivery receipts
  * Client-side timing measurements
  * Proxy server logs
  * May be used as alternative verification approaches.
* This test should be repeated under various load conditions to ensure performance remains acceptable even during peak usage times.
* Special attention should be paid to actions that involve external API calls (e.g., payment link generation), as these may have additional latency factors.
* The 10-second threshold is specifically for critical actions; non-critical actions may have different performance requirements.
