# HLT-TC-018: Error Message Handling in All Supported Languages

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 17, 2025
**Author:** AI Assistant (Claude)

## 1. Test Overview
This HLT verifies that Township Connect provides clear, helpful, and correctly translated error messages in all supported languages (English, isiXhosa, and Afrikaans) when users trigger error conditions.

## 2. User Story / Scenario
* **Feature (PRD 6.2):** WhatsApp-Native interface with multilingual support.
* **Scenario:** Users in different language contexts trigger error conditions and receive appropriate error messages in their selected language.

## 3. Preconditions
* Three test WhatsApp accounts are available and registered with Township Connect, each with a different language preference set (English, isiXhosa, and Afrikaans).
* The system has error handling mechanisms implemented for various error conditions.
* All required backend services (Supabase, n8n, Redis, etc.) are operational.

## 4. Test Steps

| Step | User Action (via WhatsApp) | Expected System Response (WhatsApp Message & Backend) |
|------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **English User:** Send an invalid command: "abcxyz" | System responds with a clear error message in English explaining that the command is not recognized and suggesting valid commands or providing help information. |
| 2 | **isiXhosa User:** Send an invalid command: "abcxyz" | System responds with the equivalent error message in grammatically correct isiXhosa, providing the same level of helpful guidance. |
| 3 | **Afrikaans User:** Send an invalid command: "abcxyz" | System responds with the equivalent error message in grammatically correct Afrikaans, providing the same level of helpful guidance. |
| 4 | **English User:** Attempt to log a sale with invalid format: "Sale xyz" | System responds with an error message in English explaining the correct format for logging a sale. |
| 5 | **isiXhosa User:** Attempt to log a sale with invalid format: "Intengiso xyz" | System responds with an equivalent error message in isiXhosa explaining the correct format. |
| 6 | **Afrikaans User:** Attempt to log a sale with invalid format: "Verkoop xyz" | System responds with an equivalent error message in Afrikaans explaining the correct format. |
| 7 | **English User:** Attempt to generate a payment link with invalid amount: "SnapScan abc" | System responds with an error message in English explaining that a valid numeric amount is required. |
| 8 | **isiXhosa User:** Attempt to generate a payment link with invalid amount: "SnapScan abc" | System responds with an equivalent error message in isiXhosa. |
| 9 | **Afrikaans User:** Attempt to generate a payment link with invalid amount: "SnapScan abc" | System responds with an equivalent error message in Afrikaans. |

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (AI Verifiable)
* All error messages are provided in the user's selected language.
* Error messages are grammatically correct and use natural language in each supported language.
* Error messages are clear, specific to the error condition, and provide helpful guidance on how to correct the issue.
* The content and helpfulness of error messages is equivalent across all languages (i.e., users of all languages receive the same level of support).
* Error messages are concise and data-light (â‰¤5KB).
* The system logs error occurrences for monitoring and improvement purposes.

## 7. Notes
* This test specifically focuses on the language quality and helpfulness of error messages, not on the technical accuracy of error detection.
* For AI verification purposes, error messages in each language should be analyzed for grammatical correctness, clarity, and helpfulness.
* The test should be expanded to cover other common error conditions specific to Township Connect's functionality.
* Error messages should be evaluated by native speakers of each language to ensure they are natural and culturally appropriate.
* This test complements HLT-TC-032 (Unrecognized Command Handling) but focuses specifically on the multilingual aspect of error messages.
