# HLT-TC-027: Baileys Connection Stability and Message Reliability

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 17, 2025
**Author:** AI Assistant (Claude)

## 1. Test Overview
This HLT verifies that Township Connect maintains a stable WhatsApp connection via the Baileys library over extended periods, ensuring reliable message delivery and reception without unexpected disconnections or message loss.

## 2. User Story / Scenario
* **Feature:** Reliable WhatsApp connectivity via Baileys integration.
* **Scenario (HLT Strategy 4.7):** Test Baileys connection stability over an extended period with keep-alive messages. Verification: Connection remains active; messages are sent and received reliably.

## 3. Preconditions
* Township Connect is fully operational with the Baileys WhatsApp integration configured.
* System logging is configured to capture connection events, disconnections, and message delivery status.
* Test WhatsApp account is set up and connected to Township Connect.
* Test environment is representative of production conditions.
* Monitoring tools are available to track connection status and message delivery.

## 4. Test Steps

| Step | Test Action | Expected System Response & Observation |
|------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | Establish initial connection between test WhatsApp account and Township Connect | Connection is established successfully. System logs show successful authentication and connection. |
| 2 | Configure system to log all connection-related events: <br>- Connection establishment <br>- Keep-alive messages <br>- Disconnections <br>- Reconnection attempts <br>- Message delivery status | Logging is correctly configured to capture all relevant connection events with timestamps. |
| 3 | Send an initial test message from user to system | Message is delivered successfully. System responds appropriately. Logs show successful message receipt and processing. |
| 4 | Configure automated keep-alive messages to be sent every 5 minutes | Keep-alive message configuration is applied. System is prepared to send periodic messages to maintain connection. |
| 5 | Begin extended connection stability test for 4 hours, with the following activities: <br>- Periodic user-to-system messages (every 15 minutes) <br>- System-initiated keep-alive messages (every 5 minutes) <br>- Monitoring of connection status <br>- Logging of all events | Connection remains stable throughout the 4-hour period. All messages are delivered successfully in both directions. Logs show continuous connection without unexpected disconnects. |
| 6 | During the test period, simulate brief network interruptions (30 seconds) | System detects the disconnection and automatically reconnects when network is available. No message loss occurs (messages are queued and delivered after reconnection). |
| 7 | Send messages of various types during the test period: <br>- Simple text messages <br>- Commands (e.g., "/lang english") <br>- Business transactions (e.g., "Sale 50 snacks") <br>- Information requests | All message types are processed correctly. No message type causes connection issues. |
| 8 | After the 4-hour period, analyze connection logs | Logs show: <br>- Stable connection throughout the test period <br>- Successful delivery of all messages <br>- Proper handling of any network interruptions <br>- No unexpected disconnections <br>- Consistent message processing times |
| 9 | Calculate message delivery reliability metrics: <br>- Percentage of messages successfully delivered <br>- Average delivery time <br>- Reconnection success rate | Metrics show: <br>- >99% message delivery success rate <br>- Consistent delivery times within expected thresholds <br>- 100% reconnection success after network interruptions |

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (AI Verifiable)
* The WhatsApp connection via Baileys remains stable for the entire 4-hour test period without unexpected disconnections.
* Any disconnections caused by simulated network issues are followed by automatic reconnection within 60 seconds of network restoration.
* All messages sent during the test period (both user-to-system and system-to-user) are delivered successfully.
* If network interruptions occur, messages are properly queued and delivered once connection is restored.
* Keep-alive messages function as expected to maintain the connection.
* System logs provide clear visibility into connection status, disconnections, reconnections, and message delivery events.
* Message delivery success rate exceeds 99%.
* The system demonstrates the ability to maintain stable connections over extended periods, which is essential for reliable service.

## 7. Notes
* This test focuses specifically on connection stability and message reliability, not on the functional correctness of message processing.
* For AI verification purposes, connection logs and message delivery statistics should be analyzed.
* The 4-hour test period is a minimum; in a production environment, longer stability tests (24+ hours) would be advisable.
* Special attention should be paid to:
  * Memory usage patterns over time (to detect memory leaks in the connection handling)
  * Reconnection behavior after various durations of network interruption
  * Message queuing and delivery after reconnection
  * Any degradation in performance over extended connection periods
* This test is critical for ensuring Township Connect provides reliable service to users, especially in areas with potentially unstable network conditions.
* Consider testing with various network conditions that simulate real-world scenarios in townships:
  * Intermittent connectivity
  * High latency
  * Low bandwidth
  * Network congestion
* Document any connection management strategies implemented (e.g., exponential backoff for reconnection attempts, message persistence) and verify they work as intended.
