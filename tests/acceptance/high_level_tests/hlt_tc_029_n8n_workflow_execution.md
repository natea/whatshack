# HLT-TC-029: n8n Workflow Execution and Outcome Verification

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 17, 2025
**Author:** AI Assistant (Claude)

## 1. Test Overview
This HLT verifies that Township Connect's n8n workflows execute correctly when triggered, complete successfully, and produce the expected outcomes in terms of data changes, notifications, or other system actions.

## 2. User Story / Scenario
* **Feature:** n8n workflow integration for automated processes and integrations.
* **Scenario (HLT Strategy 4.7):** Trigger an n8n workflow (e.g., a scheduled reminder or a complex service request). Verification: Workflow executes successfully and produces the correct outcome (e.g., a WhatsApp message is sent).

## 3. Preconditions
* Township Connect is fully operational with n8n integration configured.
* Test WhatsApp accounts are set up for workflow testing.
* n8n instance is accessible for monitoring workflow executions.
* Key workflows are identified for testing, including:
  * User-triggered workflows (e.g., via specific commands)
  * System-triggered workflows (e.g., scheduled tasks)
  * Event-based workflows (e.g., triggered by database changes)
* Access to n8n execution logs is available.

## 4. Test Steps

| Step | Test Action | Expected System Response & Verification |
|------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | Identify and document all n8n workflows used in Township Connect | Complete inventory of workflows is created, including trigger mechanisms and expected outcomes. |
| 2 | Configure n8n to provide detailed execution logs | Logging is correctly configured to capture workflow execution details, including start time, completion time, and execution path. |
| 3 | **User-Triggered Workflow:** User sends a command that triggers an n8n workflow (e.g., "SnapScan 75" to generate a payment link) | Workflow is triggered. n8n logs show workflow execution started. Workflow completes successfully. Expected outcome (payment link generation) is achieved and verified. |
| 4 | **Scheduled Workflow:** Identify a scheduled workflow (e.g., daily summary, reminder) and wait for its scheduled execution time | At the scheduled time, workflow executes automatically. n8n logs show workflow execution started and completed. Expected outcome (e.g., summary message sent) is achieved and verified. |
| 5 | **Event-Based Workflow:** Perform an action that triggers an event-based workflow (e.g., adding a new sale that triggers a milestone notification) | Event is detected and workflow is triggered. n8n logs show workflow execution started and completed. Expected outcome (e.g., milestone notification) is achieved and verified. |
| 6 | **Complex Multi-Step Workflow:** Trigger a workflow that involves multiple steps and external service integrations | Workflow executes all steps in the correct sequence. n8n logs show successful progression through all steps. Expected outcomes from all steps are achieved and verified. |
| 7 | **Error Handling:** Deliberately trigger a workflow with invalid input or simulate an external service failure | Workflow handles the error gracefully. n8n logs show appropriate error handling. System provides appropriate user feedback. No system crash or data corruption occurs. |
| 8 | **Concurrent Workflow Execution:** Trigger multiple workflows simultaneously | All workflows execute correctly without interference. n8n handles the concurrent load appropriately. All expected outcomes are achieved and verified. |
| 9 | **Long-Running Workflow:** Trigger a workflow that involves time-consuming operations | Workflow executes to completion without timeout. n8n logs show successful execution. Expected outcome is achieved and verified. |
| 10 | Analyze n8n execution logs for all tested workflows | Logs confirm successful execution of all workflows, with appropriate handling of any errors or exceptions. |

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (AI Verifiable)
* All n8n workflows trigger correctly when the appropriate conditions are met (user action, schedule, event).
* Workflows execute all defined steps in the correct sequence.
* Workflows complete successfully within expected timeframes.
* Each workflow produces the expected outcomes, which may include:
  * Database updates
  * WhatsApp messages sent
  * External API calls
  * File generation
  * Notifications
* Workflow error handling functions correctly, with appropriate logging and user feedback.
* n8n execution logs provide sufficient detail for monitoring and troubleshooting.
* Concurrent workflow execution is handled correctly without resource contention issues.
* Long-running workflows complete successfully without timeout issues.
* The n8n integration demonstrates reliability and robustness under various conditions.

## 7. Notes
* This test focuses specifically on n8n workflow execution and outcomes, not on the detailed functionality of the features implemented via these workflows.
* For AI verification purposes, n8n execution logs and outcome verification data should be analyzed.
* The test should cover a representative sample of all major workflow types used in Township Connect.
* Special attention should be paid to:
  * Error handling and recovery mechanisms
  * Workflow performance under load
  * Integration points with external services
  * Data consistency across workflow steps
  * Handling of long-running operations
* This test is critical for ensuring the reliability of automated processes in Township Connect.
* Consider testing workflow versioning and deployment processes if applicable.
* Document any workflow optimization strategies implemented and verify they work as intended.
* For complex workflows, consider creating visual execution path diagrams to aid in verification.
* Verify that workflow execution is properly logged for audit and troubleshooting purposes.
