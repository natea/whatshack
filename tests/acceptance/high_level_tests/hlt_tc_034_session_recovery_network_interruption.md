# HLT-TC-034: Session Recovery/Guidance on Network Interruption

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 17, 2025
**Author:** AI Assistant (Claude)

## 1. Test Overview
This HLT verifies that Township Connect handles network interruptions gracefully by attempting to recover sessions, resending/receiving messages upon reconnection, and providing appropriate guidance to users when network issues occur.

## 2. User Story / Scenario
* **Feature:** Resilience to network interruptions in township environments with potentially unstable connectivity.
* **Scenario (HLT Strategy 4.8):** Session Recovery/Guidance on Network Interruption. Simulating a brief network drop. System attempts to resend/receive messages upon reconnection or provides guidance. Logs indicate recovery attempts.

## 3. Preconditions
* Township Connect is fully operational with WhatsApp integration via Baileys.
* Test WhatsApp accounts are set up for testing.
* System logging is configured to capture connection events, disconnections, and recovery attempts.
* Test environment allows for simulation of network interruptions.

## 4. Test Steps

| Step | Test Action | Expected System Response & Verification |
|------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | Configure system logging to capture detailed information about network connectivity, disconnections, and recovery attempts | Logging is correctly configured to capture all relevant network events with timestamps. |
| 2 | Establish a baseline connection between test WhatsApp account and Township Connect | Connection is established successfully. System logs show successful authentication and connection. |
| 3 | **Brief Network Interruption (Client Side):** Simulate a brief (30-second) network interruption on the client side while in the middle of a multi-step interaction | WhatsApp client detects network loss. Upon network restoration, WhatsApp client reconnects to Township Connect. System detects reconnection and resumes the interaction. Any pending messages are delivered. System logs show disconnection and reconnection events. |
| 4 | **Brief Network Interruption (Server Side):** Simulate a brief (30-second) network interruption on the server side while in the middle of a multi-step interaction | System detects network loss. Upon network restoration, system reestablishes connection with WhatsApp. Any pending messages are processed. System logs show disconnection and reconnection events, along with recovery attempts. |
| 5 | **Message Queuing During Disconnection:** Send a message from client during network interruption | Message is queued locally on the client. Upon network restoration, queued message is sent to the system. System processes the message and responds appropriately. System logs show message receipt after reconnection. |
| 6 | **Server Message During Disconnection:** Trigger the system to send a message during network interruption | System detects delivery failure. System queues the message for retry. Upon network restoration, system resends the message. Client receives the message. System logs show delivery attempts and successful delivery. |
| 7 | **Extended Network Interruption:** Simulate a longer (5-minute) network interruption | System maintains session state during the extended interruption. Upon network restoration, system reestablishes connection and resumes interaction. If session timeout occurs, system provides appropriate guidance for restarting the interaction. System logs show timeout handling if applicable. |
| 8 | **Partial Network Degradation:** Simulate poor network conditions (high latency, packet loss) rather than complete disconnection | System adapts to degraded network conditions. Messages are still delivered, possibly with delays. System prioritizes message delivery reliability over speed. System logs show adaptation to network conditions. |
| 9 | **Multiple Consecutive Interruptions:** Simulate several brief network interruptions in quick succession | System handles repeated disconnections and reconnections gracefully. Session state is maintained. Interaction can be completed despite interruptions. System logs show multiple recovery attempts. |
| 10 | **User Guidance:** If network issues persist beyond recovery thresholds, verify system provides appropriate guidance | System detects persistent connectivity issues. System provides user-friendly guidance on troubleshooting or alternative actions. Guidance is provided in the user's language. System logs show decision to provide guidance. |

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (AI Verifiable)
* The system detects network interruptions and logs them appropriately.
* Upon network restoration, the system automatically attempts to recover the session.
* Messages sent during network interruptions are queued and delivered when connectivity is restored.
* The system maintains session state during brief network interruptions.
* For extended interruptions that exceed timeout thresholds, the system provides clear guidance on how to resume the interaction.
* The system adapts to degraded network conditions, prioritizing reliability over speed.
* User guidance for network issues is provided in the user's language and offers practical troubleshooting steps.
* The system remains stable during and after network interruptions.
* System logs provide clear visibility into disconnection events, recovery attempts, and message delivery retries.
* The overall user experience remains coherent despite network interruptions.

## 7. Notes
* This test focuses specifically on handling network interruptions, which is critical for ensuring reliability in township environments with potentially unstable connectivity.
* For AI verification purposes, system logs and message delivery records should be analyzed, though some aspects may require human observation to fully verify.
* The test should simulate various network conditions commonly encountered in township environments:
  * Brief disconnections
  * Extended disconnections
  * High latency
  * Packet loss
  * Intermittent connectivity
* Special attention should be paid to:
  * Session state preservation during interruptions
  * Message queuing and delivery reliability
  * Recovery mechanisms and their effectiveness
  * User guidance when automatic recovery is not possible
  * System stability during network fluctuations
* This test complements HLT-TC-027 (Baileys Connection Stability) but focuses more specifically on recovery from network interruptions rather than general connection stability.
* Consider testing with various types of interactions (simple commands, multi-step processes, data entry) to ensure recovery works across all interaction patterns.
* Document any network resilience strategies implemented (e.g., exponential backoff, heartbeat mechanisms, session state persistence) and verify they work as intended.
* Note that full AI verification of this test may be challenging, as some aspects of network behavior and recovery may require human observation to fully assess.
