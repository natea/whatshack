# Primary Findings: n8n Setup and Python Integration - Part 3

This document continues the primary findings, focusing on how a Python application can trigger n8n workflows and how n8n can interact with Python scripts or applications.

## 5. Python Application Triggering n8n Workflows (Addresses Q3.1, Q3.2, Q3.3)

A Python application can trigger an n8n workflow by making an HTTP request (typically POST) to a webhook URL exposed by an n8n Webhook node.

### 5.1. Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 5.1.1. Set Up n8n Webhook Node
1.  In your n8n instance, create a new workflow or open an existing one.
2.  Add a "Webhook" node as the trigger (starting node) for the workflow [S5-1, S5-2].
3.  Configure the Webhook node:
    *   **HTTP Method:** Set to `POST` (or `GET` if appropriate, but POST is common for sending data).
    *   **Path:** Define a unique path for your webhook.
    *   **Authentication:** Optionally, configure basic authentication or rely on token-based auth handled in the workflow.
4.  Note the "Test URL" and "Production URL" provided by the Webhook node.
5.  Ensure the n8n workflow is activated for the Production URL to be live.

#### 5.1.2. Python Code to Trigger n8n Webhook
The `requests` library in Python can be used to send an HTTP POST request with a JSON payload to the n8n webhook URL.

```python
import requests
import json
import os # For securely accessing API keys

# --- Configuration ---
# The production URL from your n8n Webhook node
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/your-unique-production-path"
# Securely retrieve API key (e.g., from an environment variable)
N8N_API_KEY = os.environ.get("N8N_SHARED_SECRET_KEY") # Example: A shared secret

# Data to send to the n8n workflow
payload = {
    "customerId": "cust_12345",
    "orderValue": 99.99,
    "items": [
        {"sku": "ABC", "quantity": 1},
        {"sku": "XYZ", "quantity": 2}
    ]
}

# Headers for the request
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
if N8N_API_KEY:
    headers["X-N8N-Api-Key"] = N8N_API_KEY # Custom header for your auth logic in n8n
    # Or use n8n's built-in webhook authentication if configured

# --- Make the Request ---
try:
    print(f"Sending POST request to: {N8N_WEBHOOK_URL}")
    print(f"Payload: {json.dumps(payload, indent=2)}")

    response = requests.post(
        N8N_WEBHOOK_URL,
        json=payload,  # `requests` library automatically sets Content-Type to application/json
        headers=headers,
        timeout=10  # Seconds to wait for the server to send data before giving up
    )

    # Raise an exception for HTTP errors (4xx or 5xx)
    response.raise_for_status()

    print(f"Successfully triggered n8n workflow.")
    print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
    try:
        # n8n might respond with JSON if the workflow uses a "Respond to Webhook" node
        print(f"Response from n8n: {response.json()}")
    except requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError:
        # Or it might send a simple 200 OK with no body or non-JSON content
        print(f"Response from n8n (raw): {response.text}")

except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:
    print(f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}")
    print(f"Status Code: {http_err.response.status_code}")
    print(f"Response Body: {http_err.response.text}")
except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as conn_err:
    print(f"Connection error occurred: {conn_err}")
except requests.exceptions.Timeout as timeout_err:
    print(f"Request timed out: {timeout_err}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as req_err:
    print(f"An error occurred with the request: {req_err}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

```

### 5.2. Handling HTTP Responses from n8n

*   **Success (2xx Status Codes):**
    *   A `200 OK` usually indicates n8n received the request and the workflow started (if n8n is configured for immediate response).
    *   A `202 Accepted` might be used if the request is queued.
    *   The Python code should check `response.status_code` and `response.ok`.
    *   If the n8n workflow is designed to send data back using a "Respond to Webhook" node, `response.json()` or `response.text` can be used to get the data [S5-1].
*   **Client Errors (4xx Status Codes):**
    *   `400 Bad Request`: The payload might be malformed, or missing required data.
    *   `401 Unauthorized` / `403 Forbidden`: Authentication failed (e.g., invalid API key, or n8n webhook auth failed).
    *   `404 Not Found`: The webhook URL might be incorrect, or the n8n workflow is not active.
    *   The Python application should log these errors and potentially notify developers. Retrying usually doesn't help without fixing the request.
*   **Server Errors (5xx Status Codes):**
    *   `500 Internal Server Error`, `502 Bad Gateway`, `503 Service Unavailable`: Indicates an issue on the n8n server side.
    *   These might be transient. The Python application could implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for these errors.
*   **Timeouts:**
    *   Handled by the `timeout` parameter in `requests.post()`.
    *   Can occur if n8n takes too long to respond (e.g., a long-running workflow if n8n is not set to respond immediately).
    *   Consider retrying or queuing the request.

### 5.3. Security Best Practices for Communication

*   **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS for the n8n webhook URL to encrypt data in transit. This is critical.
*   **Authentication:**
    *   **API Keys/Shared Secrets:** Include a pre-shared secret or API key in the HTTP headers (e.g., `X-API-Key`, `Authorization: Bearer <token>`). The n8n workflow must then validate this key using an "IF" node or a "Function" node as the first step.
    *   **n8n Built-in Webhook Authentication:** The n8n Webhook node itself can be configured with Basic Authentication or Header Auth [S5-2].
*   **Secure Key Storage:** In the Python application, API keys or tokens should be stored securely (e.g., environment variables, secrets management services) and not hardcoded.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   The Python application should validate data before sending it if possible.
    *   The n8n workflow should *always* validate incoming data from the webhook, even if it's from a trusted source.
*   **IP Whitelisting:** If the Python application has a static IP, consider configuring the n8n instance's firewall or reverse proxy to only accept requests from that IP for the specific webhook path.

### 5.4. Key Considerations
*   **Payload Structure:** Ensure the JSON payload sent by Python matches the structure expected by the n8n workflow. Mismatches are a common source of errors.
*   **Idempotency:** If there's a risk of duplicate triggers (e.g., due to retries), design the n8n workflow to be idempotent. This means processing the same request multiple times should have the same effect as processing it once (e.g., by checking if a record with a unique ID from the payload already exists).
*   **Error Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging in both the Python application (for request attempts and responses) and the n8n workflow (for processing steps and errors).

### 5.5. Alternatives to Direct Webhook Triggering
*   **Message Queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis Streams, AWS SQS):**
    *   Python publishes a message to a queue.
    *   n8n has a trigger node that listens to this queue.
    *   Provides decoupling, resilience, and better handling of backpressure.
*   **Polling (Less Ideal for Real-time):**
    *   Python writes data to a database or an API endpoint.
    *   n8n workflow uses a polling trigger (e.g., "Interval" node + "HTTP Request" node) to periodically check for new data.

Using webhooks is generally the most direct and efficient method for real-time triggering of n8n workflows from a Python application when immediate processing is desired.

## 6. n8n Workflow Interacting with Python (Addresses Q4.1, Q4.2, Q4.3, Q4.4)

n8n workflows can execute Python scripts locally or interact with Python applications by calling their HTTP API endpoints.

### 6.1. Local Python Script Execution via "Execute Command" Node

This method is suitable when n8n and the Python script reside on the same server or within the same containerized environment.

#### 6.1.1. n8n Node Involved
*   **Execute Command Node:** This node allows running arbitrary shell commands, including executing Python scripts.

#### 6.1.2. Passing Data to Python Script
*   **Standard Input (stdin):**
    *   In the "Execute Command" node, pipe data from a previous n8n node (often JSON) to the script's stdin.
    *   Command: `python /path/to/your/script.py`
    *   In the node's "Input Data" field (or similar, depending on exact n8n version/UI): `{{ $json.dataToPass }}` (assuming `dataToPass` is an object/string from a previous node). n8n will typically send this as a string to stdin.
    *   Python script (`script.py`):
      ```python
      import sys
      import json

      # Read data from stdin
      input_str = sys.stdin.read()
      try:
          data_from_n8n = json.loads(input_str)
          # Process data_from_n8n
          result = {"received": data_from_n8n, "processed_value": data_from_n8n.get("some_key", 0) * 2}
      except json.JSONDecodeError:
          result = {"error": "Invalid JSON input", "received_raw": input_str}

      # Output result to stdout (which n8n will capture)
      print(json.dumps(result))
      ```
*   **Command Line Arguments:**
    *   Pass data as command-line arguments.
    *   Command: `python /path/to/your/script.py "{{ $json.param1 }}" "{{ $json.param2 }}"`
    *   Python script: Use `sys.argv` to access arguments.
*   **Temporary Files:**
    *   n8n writes data to a temporary file (e.g., using "Write Binary File" or "Move Binary Data" nodes if data is binary, or "Function" node to write text).
    *   Pass the file path as an argument to the Python script.
    *   Python script reads from this file.

#### 6.1.3. Receiving Data from Python Script
*   **Standard Output (stdout):**
    *   The "Execute Command" node captures the script's stdout.
    *   If the Python script prints JSON to stdout, n8n can often parse this automatically or with a subsequent "Function" node (`JSON.parse(data)`).
*   **Standard Error (stderr):**
    *   stderr is also captured and can be used for error information.
*   **Exit Code:**
    *   The node captures the script's exit code. A non-zero exit code usually indicates an error.
*   **Output Files:**
    *   Python script writes results to a known file location.
    *   n8n uses "Read Binary File" / "Read File" node to read the output.

#### 6.1.4. Security Considerations
*   **Permissions:** Ensure the user running the n8n process has execute permissions for the Python interpreter and the script, but restrict permissions as much as possible (Principle of Least Privilege) [S6-5].
*   **Path Traversal/Injection:** Be extremely cautious if file paths or command arguments are constructed from user/external input. Sanitize inputs rigorously.
*   **Environment Variables:** Python scripts might require specific environment variables. These can sometimes be set within the "Execute Command" node's environment settings or must be available to the n8n process itself. Store secrets in n8n's credential manager or environment variables, not directly in the command [S6-2, S6-5].
*   **Resource Limits:** Long-running or resource-intensive scripts can impact n8n's performance.

#### 6.1.5. Error Handling
*   Check the exit code from the "Execute Command" node.
*   Parse stderr for error messages.
*   Use n8n's "Error Trigger" or "IF" nodes based on the outcome.

### 6.2. Calling HTTP API Endpoint Exposed by Python Application

This is a more robust and scalable method, especially for remote Python applications or microservices.

#### 6.2.1. n8n Node Involved
*   **HTTP Request Node:** This node is used to make HTTP calls (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) to any URL, including APIs built with Python (e.g., using Flask, FastAPI, Django).

#### 6.2.2. Python Application Setup (Example with FastAPI)
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import os

app = FastAPI()

# --- Security ---
# Example: Simple API Key Auth. In production, use a more robust mechanism.
EXPECTED_API_KEY = os.environ.get("PYTHON_APP_API_KEY", "default_secret_key_for_dev")

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    value: float

@app.post("/process-data/")
async def process_data_endpoint(item: Item, api_key: str = fastapi.Header(None, alias="X-API-Key")):
    if api_key != EXPECTED_API_KEY:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid API Key")

    # Example processing
    processed_result = f"Processed item '{item.name}' with new value {item.value * 1.1}"
    return {"message": "Data processed successfully", "result": processed_result, "input_received": item}

# To run (example): uvicorn main:app --reload
```

#### 6.2.3. n8n Workflow Configuration
*   **HTTP Request Node Settings:**
    *   **URL:** The URL of the Python API endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/process-data/` or `https://api.yourdomain.com/process-data/`).
    *   **Method:** `POST` (or as appropriate for the API).
    *   **Send Body:** `JSON`.
    *   **Body Parameters (or JSON Body):** Construct the JSON payload to send to the API using expressions from previous n8n nodes.
      Example JSON Body: `{{ { "name": $json.productName, "value": $json.productPrice } }}`
    *   **Headers:** Add necessary headers, especially for authentication.
        *   `Content-Type`: `application/json`
        *   `X-API-Key` (or `Authorization`): `{{ $credentials.pythonAppApiKey.key }}` (assuming API key stored in n8n credentials).

#### 6.2.4. Passing Data to Python API
*   Data is sent as the JSON body of the HTTP request, as configured in the "HTTP Request" node.
*   Query parameters can also be used for GET requests.

#### 6.2.5. Receiving Data from Python API
*   The "HTTP Request" node receives the HTTP response from the Python API.
*   The response body (typically JSON) will be available in the output of the node (e.g., `{{ $json.data }}` or `{{ $json.body }}` depending on n8n version and API response structure).
*   Response headers and status code are also available.

#### 6.2.6. Security Considerations
*   **HTTPS:** The Python API endpoint should be served over HTTPS.
*   **Authentication:** Secure the API endpoint.
    *   API Keys (as in the FastAPI example).
    *   OAuth2 / JWT tokens.
    *   Store client credentials/keys securely in n8n's credential manager [S6-2].
*   **Input Validation:** The Python API should validate all incoming data.
*   **Network Security:** Firewalls, VPCs if applicable.

#### 6.2.7. Error Handling
*   The "HTTP Request" node has settings to "Continue on Fail" or "Throw Error".
*   Check the `statusCode` from the response.
    *   `2xx`: Success.
    *   `4xx`: Client-side error (e.g., bad request from n8n, authentication failure).
    *   `5xx`: Server-side error in the Python application.
*   Use "IF" nodes or "Error Trigger" nodes in n8n to handle different response codes.
*   The Python API should return meaningful error messages and status codes [S6-2, S6-3].

### 6.3. n8n's Built-in "Python" Node (Limited Use)
*   n8n has a (beta or community) "Python" node that allows running small, self-contained Python snippets directly within the workflow [S6-4].
*   **Limitations:**
    *   May not have access to all system libraries or the ability to install custom packages easily.
    *   Not suitable for complex scripts or those with heavy dependencies.
    *   Environment management can be tricky.
*   **Use Case:** Simple data transformations or calculations that are easier to express in Python than with n8n's built-in expression language or Function node (JavaScript).

### 6.4. General Best Practices
*   **Data Format:** JSON is generally the easiest format for data exchange between n8n and Python [S6-1, S6-5].
*   **Modularity:** Keep Python scripts/API endpoints focused on specific tasks.
*   **Logging:** Implement logging in both n8n (workflow execution logs) and the Python script/application for easier debugging.
*   **Containerization (Docker):** For more complex Python applications or scripts with specific dependencies, consider containerizing them with Docker. n8n (if self-hosted) could then potentially interact with these containers (e.g., via `docker exec` or by calling APIs exposed by the container) [S6-2, S6-3].

Choosing between local execution and an HTTP API depends on factors like where n8n is hosted, where the Python code can run, complexity, scalability needs, and security requirements. HTTP APIs generally offer better decoupling and scalability.
