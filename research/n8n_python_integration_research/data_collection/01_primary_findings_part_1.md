# Primary Findings: n8n Setup and Python Integration - Part 1

This document contains the initial findings from the research, focusing on n8n deployment options.

## 1. Self-Hosting n8n using Docker (Addresses Q1.1)

Self-hosting n8n with Docker provides control over the instance but requires technical knowledge of server configuration, resource management, and application security [S1-1].

### 1.1. Prerequisites
*   Basic knowledge of server and container management.
*   Docker installed on the host system.
*   Understanding of application security principles [S1-1].

### 1.2. Installation Steps

#### 1.2.1. Install Docker
Docker must be downloaded and installed on the system [S1-5].

#### 1.2.2. Start n8n with Docker (Basic Setup with SQLite)
The following command can be used to start n8n with Docker, using SQLite for the database and persisting data to a local Docker volume:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
  n8nio/n8n
```
This command:
*   Creates a Docker container named "n8n".
*   Exposes n8n on port `5678`.
*   Mounts a Docker volume named `n8n_data` to `/home/node/.n8n` within the container to persist data [S1-2].

#### 1.2.3. Access n8n
Once the container is running, n8n can be accessed via a web browser at `http://localhost:5678` [S1-2].

### 1.3. Using n8n with PostgreSQL (Recommended for Production)
For production environments, using PostgreSQL as the database is recommended over the default SQLite. The Docker command needs to be modified to include PostgreSQL connection details:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
  -e DB_TYPE=postgresdb \
  -e DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=<POSTGRES_HOST> \
  -e DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=<POSTGRES_DATABASE> \
  -e DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=<POSTGRES_USER> \
  -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD> \
  n8nio/n8n
```
Replace placeholders (`<POSTGRES_HOST>`, etc.) with actual PostgreSQL connection details [S1-2].

### 1.4. Using Docker Compose
Docker Compose is recommended for easier management of n8n and its dependencies (like a PostgreSQL database). A `docker-compose.yml` file can be created, and then n8n can be started with `docker-compose up -d`. Example `docker-compose.yml` files, including configurations for PostgreSQL, are available in the n8n hosting repository [S1-2].

### 1.5. Resource Requirements (Estimated)
While not explicitly detailed with precise figures in the initial search, typical resource requirements for similar applications suggest:
*   **CPU:** Minimum 2 cores recommended for standard usage.
*   **RAM:** At least 2GB, with 4GB recommended for production environments.
*   **Disk Space:** At least 10GB for the application and data storage. More space will be needed depending on workflow volume, complexity, and data retention policies.

### 1.6. Important Security Considerations for Self-Hosting
*   **Encryption Key:** The directory `/home/node/.n8n` contains the encryption key for credentials and must be persisted. Alternatively, the `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable can be used to provide the key. If n8n cannot find an existing key on startup, it will create a new one, rendering previously saved credentials unusable [S1-2].
*   **Authentication:** Proper user authentication should be set up for the n8n instance.
*   **SSL/HTTPS:** Implementing SSL is crucial for secure connections to the n8n instance, especially if it's exposed to the internet.

### 1.7. Alternative: n8n Cloud
For users not experienced with server management, n8n recommends using their cloud service to avoid potential data loss, security issues, and downtime associated with self-hosting [S1-1].

## 2. Self-Hosting n8n on Replit Reserved VM (Addresses Q1.2)

Self-hosting n8n on a Replit Reserved VM is technically feasible but presents significant considerations, primarily around cost and Replit's resource usage model.

### 2.1. Cost Considerations
*   Users have reported unexpectedly high costs when running n8n on Replit Reserved VMs. For example, one user incurred €17.15 for compute units and €9.93 for PostgreSQL usage within a few days [S2-4].
*   Costs arise because Replit Reserved VMs provide dedicated, continuously running computing resources, and n8n's nature involves constant processing [S2-4].

### 2.2. Technical Limitations and Platform Characteristics
*   Replit's "Always On" applications on Reserved VMs are treated as actively using compute resources even when idle from an external perspective [S2-4].
*   n8n exhibits continuous resource usage due to:
    *   Constant Node.js processes.
    *   Background polling activities.
    *   Regular heartbeat connections.
    *   Continuous writing/reading of execution logs and metadata [S2-4].

### 2.3. Feasibility Assessment
*   Replit Reserved VMs are designed for applications requiring dedicated resources and consistent performance, such as always-on API servers and memory-intensive background tasks [S2-1].
*   While n8n's activity pattern aligns with these use cases, this alignment directly leads to continuous billing on Replit's model [S2-1].
*   Therefore, while technically possible, it may not be the most cost-effective solution for hosting n8n.

### 2.4. Potential Workarounds and Optimizations
*   **Resource Optimization:** Select the smallest Replit Reserved VM option that meets performance needs [S2-1].
*   **Database Management:** Optimize database connections or explore alternative, potentially more cost-effective, storage solutions if PostgreSQL on Replit proves too expensive.
*   **Port Configuration:** Utilize Replit's configurable port mappings to limit unnecessary external connections [S2-1].
*   **Monitoring:** Use Replit's built-in monitoring tools to identify and potentially optimize resource-intensive processes within n8n or its workflows [S2-1].

### 2.5. Alternative Approaches
*   A user mentioned creating a one-click self-hosted n8n template for Replit (as of March 2025), but cost concerns likely remain [S2-2].
*   Consider using a non-Reserved VM option on Replit with scheduled uptime/downtime if continuous operation isn't strictly necessary (though n8n is typically always-on).
*   Explore other cloud hosting platforms that might offer pricing models more suited to n8n's resource usage patterns (e.g., platforms with more generous free tiers for background tasks or different CPU/RAM billing).

In summary, self-hosting n8n on Replit Reserved VMs is possible but requires careful evaluation of the associated continuous operational costs due to Replit's billing model for such resources.
