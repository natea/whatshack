# References

This section is intended to consolidate all unique cited sources and references from the primary research findings documents. The detailed citations (e.g., [S1-1], [S2-1], etc.) are currently embedded within the following primary findings files:

*   [`../../data_collection/01_primary_findings_part_1.md`](../../data_collection/01_primary_findings_part_1.md)
*   [`../../data_collection/01_primary_findings_part_2.md`](../../data_collection/01_primary_findings_part_2.md)
*   [`../../data_collection/01_primary_findings_part_3.md`](../../data_collection/01_primary_findings_part_3.md)
*   [`../../data_collection/01_primary_findings_part_4.md`](../../data_collection/01_primary_findings_part_4.md)

A manual consolidation of these embedded source details into a unified list would typically be performed as a subsequent step to ensure each unique source is listed once with its full reference information.

**Example of how sources are cited in the primary findings:**
(From `01_primary_findings_part_1.md`)
> ### 1.1. Docker Deployment
> *   **Official Docker Image:** n8n provides an official Docker image (`n8nio/n8n`) which is the recommended way for self-hosting [S1-1, S1-2].
> *   **docker-compose:** Commonly used for easier management of the n8n container along with a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) [S1-1].
