**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 17, 2025

This document identifies potential information sources to address the key strategic questions outlined in [`research/township_connect_strategic_research/initial_queries/02_key_questions.md`](research/township_connect_strategic_research/initial_queries/02_key_questions.md:1) for the Township Connect project. The primary research tool will be the Perplexity AI search tool, accessed via MCP.

## 1. General AI Search (Perplexity MCP Tool)

This will be the primary method for gathering information. Queries will be formulated based on the key strategic questions, targeting a wide range of online resources.

**Types of Information to Seek via AI Search:**

### 1.1. Academic & Research Publications:
*   Studies on digital inclusion, mobile technology adoption, and economic development in South African townships or similar contexts.
*   Research on SME operations, challenges, and successes in informal economies.
*   Papers on user experience (UX) for low-literacy populations and multilingual application design.
*   Analysis of data privacy regulations (like POPIA) and their application in digital services.

### 1.2. Reports & White Papers from NGOs, Government, & Industry:
*   Reports from South African government bodies (e.g., Stats SA, Department of Small Business Development) on township economies, digital literacy, and mobile penetration.
*   Publications from NGOs working on poverty alleviation, digital skills training, and SME support in Cape Town or South Africa.
*   Industry reports from telecommunication companies (e.g., MTN, Vodacom) on data usage patterns, device affordability, and mobile service adoption in low-income segments.
*   Market research reports on consumer behavior, payment preferences, and technology trends in South Africa.

### 1.3. News Articles, Blogs, & Online Forums:
*   Articles from South African news outlets covering township life, business challenges, community initiatives, and technology adoption.
*   Blog posts and articles from tech developers, UX designers, and entrepreneurs working on solutions for emerging markets or similar target audiences.

### 1.4. Case Studies & Best Practices:
*   Case studies of successful (and unsuccessful) mobile-based services, particularly WhatsApp bots, targeting similar demographics or addressing similar needs in Africa or other emerging markets.
*   Best practices for:
    *   Data-light application design.
    *   Multilingual chatbot development (especially for Bantu languages like isiXhosa and Germanic languages like Afrikaans).
    *   POPIA-compliant data handling in digital services.
    *   Community engagement and user onboarding in low-resource settings.
    *   SME support programs.

### 1.5. Technical Documentation & Developer Resources:
*   Documentation for technologies mentioned in the PRD: Baileys, Node.js, n8n, Composio, Supabase, Redis Streams, Replit.
*   Developer blogs and forums discussing challenges and solutions related to these technologies, especially in contexts of scalability, reliability, and integration.
*   Information on WhatsApp API capabilities, limitations, and terms of service.
*   Technical guides on optimizing for low-RAM Android devices.

### 1.6. Competitor & Analogous Service Information:
*   Websites, articles, and user reviews of existing digital tools or services used by township entrepreneurs or residents in Cape Town.
*   Information on services offered by payment providers like SnapScan and MoMo.

## 2. Project-Internal Documents

*   **User Blueprint ([`docs/prd.md`](docs/prd.md)):** This is a foundational document providing context on requirements, features, target audience, and success metrics.
*   **Overall Project Goal:** As provided in the initial task.

## 3. Potential (Future or Indirect) Human Sources

While direct interviews are outside the scope of this AI-driven research phase, the AI search will look for summaries or reports of insights that might have originated from:

*   **Local Community Leaders & Organizations:** Individuals or groups with deep understanding of township dynamics.
*   **SMEs in Townships:** Direct experiences from potential users.
*   **Experts in South African Digital Inclusion & POPIA:** Academics, consultants, or legal professionals.
*   **Representatives from Potential Corporate Partners:** Insights into their needs and expectations.

The AI search will prioritize credible, recent, and relevant sources. All information will be critically evaluated, and sources will be documented for the final report's reference list. The focus will be on synthesizing information to answer the strategic questions rather than just listing facts.
